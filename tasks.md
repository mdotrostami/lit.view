# Lit View Task Board

Guideline: work one task at a time. When you start a task, mark it `[inprogress]`; when done, ask for review and mark it `[x]` after approval. Pick tasks by priority below—do not ask which to do next.


## How we work (AI agents)
[]


## Tasks
[] capture the Lit preview `PreviewState` lifecycle so the architecture doc explains how the coordinator owns file metadata, mock schema, and live mock data flows.
[] describe how `media/preview.css` centralizes the shared styles for both webviews, noting theme variables, layout wrappers, and field/button helpers.
[] refresh the task board once documentation updates are merged so the overview reflects the new state and styling write-ups.
